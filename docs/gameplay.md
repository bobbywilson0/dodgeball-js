# Dodgeball

## Beginning the game

Balls are placed at every other square on the middle row of the board. Players are placed in front of each ball on their respective sides. Each player rolls, the highest roll goes first. 

## Actions 

### Movement
Movement is based on the players attributes, but is a flat value (e.g. if your player has 6 movement the player can always move 6 spaces).

### Pickup ball
A player directly in front of a ball can pick it up. A ball may be held for 3 turns, then it must be thrown.

### Throw
A player holding a ball can throw it (see: combat).

### No action
A player can choose to not take an action.

## Turn

A turn is completed when any two total actions are performed for your team. Actions can be any combination of two. The amount of actions can be modified by an ability, but by default a coach gets two actions.

## Combat

Attacking coach uses the player's "throwing distance" attribute to see if their player is range. If the attacking player is in range the attacking coach rolls the die to see if they hit the defending player. The defending coach rolls a first dice to see if they catch the ball (if the defending player has a "catch" attribute greater than zero), and then rolls again to see if the player dodges the ball (this is based on the "dodge" attribute). If the attacking dice is greater than the defending dice it is a hit, otherwise it's a dodge, and tie goes to the defender.

### Combat Results

HIT: Attacker rolls higher than defender. Defending player is out. 

Example: Attacker rolls 6, defender rolls 1 for catch, defender rolls 4.

MISS: Attacker rolls lower than defender. The ball lands how ever many spaces forward was rolled.

Example: Attacker rolls 3, denfender rolls 1 for catch, defender rolls  5.

CATCH: Defender rolls catch dice and matches their percentage. Attacking player is out, defender keeps ball and releases one player on their team who is "out". 

Example: Defender rolls catch dice of 10 on a 10 sided die.

## Winning

Once you get an entire team out, you have won that game.

## Ball position

Balls land the distance that was rolled in the direction thrown. E.g. if a ball was thrown straight ahead 4 spaces but the opposing player is 5 spaces away, that ball now sits directly in front of the opposing player. If a ball travels beyond the distance of the court it is placed back in the middle. If a player is hit, the ball drops in that players spot.
